<section id="introduction" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>
<p>This individual report explores terminal on-time performance with a specific focus on the variations between the two periods, the seasonal impacts, weekday vs.&nbsp;weekend performance, borough-specific recovery, and the overall relationship between scheduled and on-time trips. The findings are intended to provide a clearer picture of how performance evolved during the pandemic and recovery phases, and how it has influenced subway system efficiency.</p>
</section>
<section id="conclusion" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3>
<p>This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of how delays, on-time performance, and safety incidents have influenced the efficiency of NYC subway lines from 2020 to 2024. By examining trends during the COVID period and the post-COVID recovery, we identified significant disruptions caused by the pandemic, such as reduced ridership, simplified operations, and subsequent challenges during the recovery phase. The findings reveal that on-time performance peaked during the early COVID period due to fewer passengers, but gradually declined through 2021, with a steady recovery beginning as the city reopened.</p>
<p>Seasonal factors, particularly winter weather disruptions, also played a key role in influencing performance, with February 2024 showing the lowest on-time performance. Borough-level analysis showed that while Queens demonstrated the fastest recovery, Brooklyn faced a slower rebound, pointing to the need for tailored recovery strategies in different boroughs. Additionally, the correlation between scheduled trips and on-time performance emphasized the importance of effective scheduling, as higher operational loads were often linked to reduced efficiency.</p>
<p>Line-specific analysis revealed that some lines, such as the GS and S 42nd, maintained exceptional reliability, while others, like S Rock, highlighted areas needing targeted improvements. Overall, this report underscores the impact of both internal and external factors, including delays, safety incidents, and operational loads, on subway efficiency. The insights derived offer a foundation for future improvements in the NYC subway system, particularly in areas where delays and performance disparities are most pronounced.</p>

<section id="data-sources" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-sources">Data sources:</h3>
<p>For this analysis, the data was sourced from the <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Terminal-On-Time-Performance-Beginning-/vtvh-gimj/data_preview">MTA Terminal On-Time Performance Dataset from 2020 to 2024</a>.The dataset contains key performance metrics including the number of scheduled trips, the number of on-time trips, and terminal on-time performance percentages for each subway line across different boroughs.</p>
</section>
<section id="limitation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitation">Limitation:</h3>
<p>While the dataset offers valuable insights, it is limited in that it focuses only on the period from 2020 to 2024, excluding long-term pre-pandemic data, which could provide additional context. Additionally, the dataset does not account for external factors such as policy changes, economic influences, and infrastructural issues, which could also influence on-time performance.</p>

<section id="the-literature" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-literature">The literature:</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/transr/v41y2021i3p374-392.html">literature</a> discusses COVID-19’s impact on public transport, emphasizing the need for evidence-based planning to address disruptions in ridership and service capacity. This is relevant to my analysis, as it mirrors the challenges faced by the NYC subway during the pandemic, such as reduced on-time performance. Their focus on recovery planning aligns with my findings on borough-specific recovery trends and the importance of optimized scheduling for post-COVID efficiency.</p>

<p>The graph shows that average on-time performance peaked in 2020 during the early COVID period, likely due to reduced ridership and simplified operations. However, performance declined through 2021 and began recovering steadily from 2022 onward, showing gradual improvement through 2024.</p>

<p>Identifying the subway lines with the highest and lowest total on-time trips helps assess operational efficiency and pinpoint performance disparities. This provides insight into how delays and on-time performance vary across lines, contributing to an understanding of their impact on system-wide efficiency and borough-specific trends from 2020 to 2024.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>• On-time performance peaked in 2020 and gradually improved from 2022, showing disruptions during COVID and recovery after.</p>
<p>• Spring (especially May) showed the highest performance, while winter (especially February) had the lowest, likely due to weather-related challenges.</p>
<p>• Queens recovered fastest, while Brooklyn showed the steepest decline and slowest recovery, with the Bronx and Manhattan showing moderate recovery.</p>
<p>• Higher scheduled trips were linked to lower on-time performance, suggesting the need for better capacity management.</p>
<p>• A strong positive correlation (0.98) between scheduled and on-time trips indicates that more scheduled trips lead to better efficiency.</p>
<p>• More scheduled trips correlated with lower on-time performance, suggesting the need for better capacity management.</p>
<p>• Reliable lines like GS and S 42nd maintained over 99% on-time performance, serving as benchmarks, while underperforming lines like S Rock revealed areas needing improvement.</p>
