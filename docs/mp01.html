<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This analysis will examine the fiscal characteristics of major U.S. public transit systems using publicly available data. For more details on the problem description, please refer to: <a href="https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/miniprojects/mini01.html">Mini-Project #01</a>. The primary objective is to answer key questions related to transit agencies, focusing on areas such as farebox recovery performance, ridership trends, and operating expenses. The analysis will involve tasks such as renaming columns, recoding modes, and addressing instructor-specified questions using various transit data sources.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-sources" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-sources">Data Sources</h3>
<p>We will use data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a> as our primary source. In particular, since we want to analyze farebox revenues, total number of trips, total number of vehicle miles traveled, and total revenues and expenses by source, we will need to analyze several different tables. (Clicking link will download the files.)</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/sites/fta.dot.gov/files/2024-04/2022%20Fare%20Revenue.xlsx">2022 Fare Revenue</a> table</li>
<li>July <a href="July 2024 Complete Monthly Ridership (with adjustments and estimates)_240903.xlsx">Monthly Ridership</a> tables</li>

<p>We will be analyzing various data from various sources. Following libraries are needed for this analysis. First check if the library is already installed and then install if not installed.</p>

<p>Since we have now setup libraries, we will now download the data to our project so that we can use later fo our analysis. You might get an error when trying to download the file programmatically.

<p>Create a new table from <code>USAGE</code> that has annual total (sum) <code>UPT</code> and <code>VRM</code> for 2022. This will require use of the <code>group_by</code>, <code>summarize</code>, and <code>filter</code> functions.

<p>The resulting table should have the following columns:</p>
<ul>

<li><code>metro_area</code></li>
<li><code>Mode</code></li>

<ol type="1">
<li>MTA New York City Transit had the most passenger trips.</li>
<li>NYC Subway saw a 91.28% drop in ridership between April 2019 and April 2020 due to COVID-19.</li>
<li>Transit Authority of Central Kentuckyâ€™s Vanpool had the highest farebox recovery, covering costs effectively through fare revenue.</li>
<li>North Carolina State Universityâ€™s Motorbus service had the lowest expenses per passenger trip.</li>
<li>The Motorbus mode, across all agencies, is the one that collects the most fare revenue for every mile the buses travel while carrying passengers.</li>
<li>The transit system with the highest total fares per Vehicle Revenue Mile is the Chicago Water Taxi in the Ferryboat mode.</li>
