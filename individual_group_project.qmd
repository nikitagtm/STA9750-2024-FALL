### What is the trend in terminal on-time performance from 2020 to 2024? How does performance differ between the COVID period (2020-2021) and post-COVID recovery (2022-2024)?

#### **Motivations and Importance of Analysis**

We wanted to analyze borough-specific data to identify key subway challenges by combining ridership, delays, and safety metrics. Higher ridership often leads to increased delays, particularly in congested areas like Manhattan. Exploring the connection between delays and safety incidents revealed that recurring issues, such as track problems, impact both reliability and safety. Seasonal factors, like winter weather, further highlighted how external conditions affect system performance.

### **Quantitative Findings and Their Qualitative Insights**

High ridership correlates with longer delays and increased safety risks, particularly during peak hours. Track-related issues emerged as a common cause of disruptions, emphasizing the need for preventive maintenance. Seasonal trends showed winter reducing system reliability, while other months performed better. Post-COVID patterns revealed shifting passenger habits and service gaps, particularly on busy lines.

### **Importance of This Analysis**

By connecting ridership, delays, and safety, we uncovered critical issues like infrastructure strain, and seasonal impacts. These insights support targeted improvements, better maintenance, resource allocation, and weather-specific strategies to enhance reliability, safety, and rider experience. This analysis demonstrates how combined metrics drive meaningful, system-wide improvements.

### **About Our Data**

For our analysis, we use multiple data sets from the New York government's official website. They focus on different metrics. First, we use transit performance data, which evaluates train wait times against scheduled intervals and delay rates during peak and off-peak hours. Secondly, for safety data, we focus on different types of incidents, including safety incidents, track-related incidents, and train-related incidents. Lastly, for ridership data, we examine metrics such as wait times and ridership. These datasets provide us a comprehensive overview of the subway performance. They are strong for operation and performance analysis and up-to-date; however, the datasets may be biased because they do not include some external factors, such as policy, economics, etc., and do not explore differences between metro lines, such as infrastructure or trains and track quality.Â 

### Trend of On-terminal by Borough(2024-2024).

The graph provides a comparative analysis of average terminal on-time performance by borough from 2020 to 2024. It highlights variations in performance across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens. We aim to uncover how delays and safety incidents may have influenced overall efficiency. This will help pinpoint areas of operational strain and provide insights for improving performance and reliability across the subway system.

The graph highlights borough-specific trends in on-time performance from 2020 to 2024, with a sharp decline in 2022 due to post-pandemic challenges. Queens consistently performed better, indicating greater resilience, while Brooklyn and the Bronx showed slower recovery and lower efficiency.The findings emphasize the need for targeted efforts to address delays, safety concerns, and operational inefficiencies.

### Seasonal Impact between (2024-2024).

Let's identify seasonal and monthly trends. The goal is to highlight how external factors, such as weather and operational challenges, impact system reliability.

The graph shows winter as the least reliable season, likely due to weather-related disruptions, while spring has the highest performance with fewer interruptions, highlighting the need for targeted strategies.

This would be the individual analysis for [On-Terminal Performance(2020-2024)](topic-https://nikitagtm.github.io/STA9750-2024-FALL/individual_report.html)
